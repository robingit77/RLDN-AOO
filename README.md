Inspiration​
RLDN-AOO inherits the core inspiration from the Animated Oat Optimization Algorithm (AOO),
which mimics the tumbling and leaping motions of Animated Oat seeds for efficient global-local search integration. 
Building on this natural metaphor, RLDN-AOO introduces novel strategies to address high-dimensional optimization 
challenges by enhancing population diversity and dynamic adaptability.​
Mechanisms​
RLDN-AOO innovates through three key mechanisms:
(i) Dynamic Niche Strategy: A three-state adaptive population division maintains diversity and escapes local optima by balancing exploration, exploitation, and transitional states;
(ii) Reinforcement Learning Adaptation: A Multi-armed Bandit model optimizes real-time strategy selection, resolving the algorithm's dynamic adaptability limitations in high-dimensional spaces;
(iii) Enhanced AOO Framework: Leverages the seed dispersal behaviors (wind/water transport, hygroscopic rolling, obstacle-triggered propulsion) to retain AOO's exploration-exploitation balance while mitigating high-dimensional performance degradation.
